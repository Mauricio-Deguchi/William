William is the culmination of the Mechanical Engineering Senior Capstone Design project at UCLA created by Damian Magana, Stephen Masson, Matthew Wang, Mauricio Deguchi, Yulong Yu & Jeffrey Purchatzke. William is a Boomerang throwing robot which can control all of the parameters required to tune the ideal boomerang throw. This repository contains all the code I developed throughout the testing process as well as the final version of the code. Our successful tests were completed using the SerialCommunication.py file for the UI, BaseArduinoFinal.ino on an Arudino Uno to control the arm motor speed, and the ArmArduinoFinal.ino file on an Arduino Mega to control the remaining parameters.
